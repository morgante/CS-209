# Meta
Syllabus is on classes

Attendance is huge (3 unexcused absences will result in a letter grade deduction)

# Object Oriented Design
Interfaces = adjectives (ex. Java's ```Comparable```)

Reduce duplicated code. Be just general enough to support conceivable future feature additions.

With multiple inheritance, avoid having to use method resolution order.

Duck typing = type enforced by properties/methods, not by definition

# Module Design
- Source-static: the targets don't change over their lifetime
- Target-static: the owners don't change over their lifetime

Arrow with white triangle is inheritance (pointing from child to parent)

UML and such have lots more power, but are also more complicated
