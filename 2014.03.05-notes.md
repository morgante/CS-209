# Breaking Things
Load testing, etc.

Breaking things helps you to find where the bottlenecks are.

# Load Testing
Determine maximum throughput. Good load testers give workload ```shapes```:

Shapes include:
- Peaking (bursts) vs continuous
- API, frontend, etc.

Do load testing so you don't end up like Friendster (slowed down under load, lost to Facebook).

The lesson of [Damocles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles) is that higher power is also more dangerous. (Find out what will make you fail before you do.)

## Load Testing Tools
- [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is one of the more full-featured load testing tools. (**Java**)
- [Gatling](http://gatling-tool.org/) is in **Scala**. Allows you to design test scenarious easily in a DSL.
- [Locust](http://locust.io/) is in **Python**. and pretty easy to use. Can test non-Python software.

# Fuzzing
Provide erroneous, unexpected, and random data to software in order to produce unexpected behaviour.

Particularly in crypto, important to have uniform reactions to bad input. SSL was broken by the fact that response time for bad data was correlated with degree of correctness. GSM baseband was compromised by fuzzing.

Part of security hardening. Similar to protecting from XSS, etc.

## Fuzzing Tools
- [Sulley](https://github.com/OpenRCE/sulley) is written in Python and completely open source.
- [Peach](http://peachfuzzer.com/) is most famous, though the open source version is hobbled. (Commercial is $3,000)
- [LOIC](http://sourceforge.net/projects/loic/) is a JavaScript and C# fuzzing toolkit.
