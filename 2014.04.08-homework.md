# Discussion
I developed a schema for a very simple user directory which is navigated via groups. On a group page, you can find the names of the group's members and add users to the group. A user can be a member of multiple groups. MongoDB and SQL both have advantages for storing this kind of user tree.

MongoDB has the advantage of storing this information very simply, with just two collections. The query for viewing a group page will be extremely efficient as all the necessary information is contained within a single document in the database. However, there is some complexity in the denormalization of user's names. Hence, updates will take longer with this system as both the user and the group collection have to be changed. Additionally, there's potential for the group documents to grow indefinitely as more and more members are added. As it grows, the ability to quickly retrieve and update this document in memory would decrease. Hence, the MongoDB implementation will be quite read-efficient but not particularly write-performant.

On the other hand, the MySQL implementation is quite efficient for writes. Adding a user to a group is simply a matter of inserting a new row into the users_groups join table. The speed of this operation is unaffected by the number of users already in the group, and the groups can grow indefinitely without running into limits. On the other hand, rendering the group page is a more complex operation as it requires querying all 3 tables (joining via the users_groups table). Hence, this is not as performant. Additionally, the schema is somewhat more complex and the necessity of writing joins will make working with it slightly more difficult.

# MongoDB Schema
```
   users
------------------
id  	| ObjectID
name 	| string
phone 	| string

   groups
------------------
id  	| ObjectID
name 	| string
members | [{id: ObjectId, name: string]
```

# SQL Schema
```
   users
------------------
id  	| int (unique key)
name 	| varchar(255)
phone 	| varchar(255)

   groups
------------------
id  	| int (unique key)
name 	| varchar(50)

	users_groups
------------------
user_id | int (foreign key)
group_id| int (foreign key)
```
