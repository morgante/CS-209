# Unit Testing
## Black Box Testing
Garbage in should produce errors out, not garbage.

## Glassbox Testing
Examines internal state

# Integration Testing
One level up from unit testing.

# Continuous Integration
Akin to Japanese JIT development, where the entire assembly line is shut down if a defective component is found.

# Final Project
Mid to large sized projects with enough complexity to require 2-3 developers. Need an external (non-self) stakeholder to gather requirements from.
