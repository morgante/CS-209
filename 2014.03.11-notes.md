# Bug Tracking Tools
- [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/) is well-hardened by Mozilla, but doesn't have extra bugs and whistles.
- [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) is more of a project management system with roadmaps, etc.
- [Apache Bloodhound](http://bloodhound.apache.org/) is an improved fork of Trac.
- **GitHub Issue Tracker** is free and in GitHub, but has way fewer features.
- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing/?tab=download) is $10 to download.

# Regression Tests
After a bug is fixed, make sure a test is added for it to make sure it never reappears.

Test and document at all points in development cycle.

# Refactoring
Refactoring reduces complexity and increases comprehensibility without changing functionality.
