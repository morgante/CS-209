# Project
Project can be paid, but preferably not in PHP or Ruby. All members of the team must receive some consideration.

# Debugging and Differential Diagnosis
A system begins to mysteriously fail. Static analysis (ex. [pylint](http://www.pylint.org/)) is one option and can be integrated into CI.

Most bugs come from corner cases, including inputs. Unit tests don't catch race conditions, etc.

Work backwards from the bad output until you find the point where the "input" is code. Then debug in that area.

Focus on your own code, because 99% of the time the bug is there. ([Select isn't broken](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault/))

Find an example of good and bad input and step through both to see where they diverge.

# Logging
It's preventative medicine and helps you to reproduce/diagnose rare bugs.

But, after the fact, no harm in ```printing``` everything.

# Exception Handling
Exceptions are exceptional: errors should rarely come up and should not be appearing in logs frequently. Don't expect them to occur.

Correct thing with exceptions is to actually handle the exception.

Hackers don't pay attention to exception handling (vs. engineers) because it decreases velocity. (Import fuckitpy)

Implement fail-safe systems, ensuring shutdown causes minimal harm (roll back what you can).

Catch exceptions close to where they're thrown, except that utility code can't understand business logic.
